<div class="content"><p>A long drive into and out of the mountains overlooking pristine valley and rivers is a feeling that can be experienced better than expressing it. Often there are things like these which are best experienced. Volunteering is one of them.</p>
<p>Youth today associates volunteering to rack up their credentials or to stand out from the crowd with an ulterior motive to go up the corporate ladder. However, we’ll restrict ourselves from these reasons as to why volunteering is beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, volunteering in a common man terminology can be defined as services you offer willingly and free of charge. These services are often yours to them. Now you can offer it to an NGO or you can just offer it whosoever needs it. To help the needy is the basic idea. I have known people who have painted old age homes, taught kids in slum schools and even offered water to the roadside vendors on a traffic light(Someone who filled up the bottles and offered it to the summer-stricken people selling things to the people on the red light).But did they receive something material in return, or received something at all? The answer is ‘YES’, they did receive something, and NO, it was not something material, it was a sense of purpose in their existence.</p>
<p>Let me try to give you reasons as to why you should wake up on a weekend to do something like this.</p>
<p><b>Creating Value:</b> What value do you possess other than your technical skills? How do you empathize with someone who is suffering from something that you never suffered from? How do you put yourself in someone’s shoes and try to connect emotionally. Volunteering lets you explore a side of yours that is far away from your technical know-how. </p>
<p><b>Learning about yourself:</b> Did you see someone is dearth of something that you have an abundance of? How did it feel? Did you feel sorry for that person and felt like sharing? You felt grateful of what you had? By Volunteering you learn about how do you feel about all this, be it poverty or lack of education or lack of basic sanitation services in some areas.</p>
<p><b>Learning about others:</b> You become aware of what other people are going through, their struggles and their journeys to make ends meet. For example: when I taught in a school situated in a slum, I learnt about the struggles of my students. These children had to maintain a household or go back to their day job as a vendor at this young age. One must see it, to believe, that there is still a lot of pain and suffering in the world.</p>
<p><b>Appreciate what you have:</b> When you see the suffering or just the basic struggles, you learn to appreciate what you have. You had education easily, others might not have it that easy, or you have a roof over your head, others might not have the same. These are few things you really become appreciative of and start to complain less about what your problems are.</p>
<p><b>Sense of self-satisfaction:</b> You did something for others and helped them. There is something really beautiful about it. You have to feel it in order to know it. There is a feeling of self satisfaction but in a different sense, because here you have done something not for yourself, but for others. There is a sense of inner peace and that mountain journey feeling when you help someone in need or just help someone in general.</p>
<p><b>A smile:</b> Once when I was teaching, I saw a smile of achievement in my students’ eyes. They had figured out the usage of “this” and “that” and by they were happy. I could see the happiness through that smile plastered on their faces. I smiled the entire week thinking about that moment. Do it for the genuine smile.</p>
<p>As I said, you have to feel it in order to know it. It is one of the single most rewarding feelings in the world that gives you a sense of purpose in your life.</p>
