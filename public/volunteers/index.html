                <div class="volunteer_content"><p>It’s been 4+ months of my association with Adhiyagya. Since its inception the number of children have increased from 12 to 120. The only reason for this manifold growth is the affection, passion and dedication of Adhiyagya team to make a difference in the lives of these kids that encourages the kids to learn and grow.</p>

					<p>I am a firm believer in the power of education &#038; strongly believe that education can bring about a substantial &#038; long term change in our society. Through Adhiyagya, I chanced upon the opportunity to  impart my knowledge to these children. There are days when the children come with their doubts after class, voluntarily ask for more homework, showing phenomenal ability to grasp lessons quickly. It&#8217;s a great pleasure to be a part of Adhiyagya</p>

The time spent at Adhiyagya is when I&#8217;m truly alive, being a part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>

                <div class="volunteer_content"><p>It has been a privilege to be a part of this organisation. Teaching is not an easy job, you need a lot of patience for it and it certainly isn&#8217;t my cup of tea but the kids made it easy and helped me with it. To see them smile &#038; have fun, and to know that I contribute something for that smile gives me immense joy and satisfaction. This has helped me to become more open, take part in other activities and events and help me realise that social work &#038; charity has a value of its own.</p>

The feeling of joy and self satisfaction I got after interacting with the kids and helping them learn new things is something words can&#8217;t describe. The kids also inspired me, despite the lack of resources they have a will to learn.</p>
