                    <p>Being able to interact with the children at Adhiyagya and being able to see them grow into individuals with such high potential and distinct personalities is probably the only inspiration that keeps both me, and the organisation going. I got to know about Adhiyagya through my sister and didn't take a moment to become a part of it. I was amazed to see such talented children and the platform Adhiyagya provided them with, which made me all the more keen in being a part of it. I didn't realize when the bond with the children outgrew the teacher- student relation to being more like a family. It fills me with immense happiness that I could be a part of Adhiyagya, something that I'll cherish for life.</p>

                    <p>The journey with Adhiyagya has so far been amazingly special and precious. What started as yet another volunteering work on weekends became an integral part of my life. The sense of belongingness and compassion that I get from here keeps me inspired to keep doing my bit. 
                    The most intriguing thing of Adhiyagya's kids is that they never give up and are always determined to learn. Its fascinating to unfold their creative minds. The love and warmth in their hearts always motivate me to be a part of their dreams.</p>

                    <p>I am fortunate enough to be a part of Adhiyagya family. This one year with the children has given me an experience which was challenging at times but invaluable in so many ways. I have worked with a positive attitude and a willingness to get involved wherever I was needed, which held me in good stead because it helped me earn the respect of my kids, I was given the opportunity to get involved, even more than I ever imagined. As teaching was never my cup of tea but once I started teaching these kids, it gave me a satisfactory feeling which made me work harder. Teaching these kids has increased my patience level as well. All in all, I have had an incredible experience with Adhiyagya.</p>

And the realisation of doing something for the betterment of our society. I am glad to be a part of this team and wish to remain with this beautiful journey of Adhiyagya throughout my life.</p>

The love that children express makes one feel special. There is still a long way to go and as a team we are all set to achieve it.</p>

                    <p>I joined Adhiyagya approximately one & half years ago. Since then, I have been teaching English to the beginners who don't know English language at all. In the beginning I was quite upset that they couldn’t learn it. Thought many times to leave them but then my goal of growing them into a good personality would have been lost. So I didn’t lose patience & kept on working hard with them. The children started taking interest gradually. Their progress is amazing.</p>

                    <p>Margaret Mead once said that children must be taught how to think, not what to think. When i first stepped into Adhiyagya, i saw exactly that happening. Though its been just 8 months for me here but its like i found a family with all the children and the volunteers. Working towards the greater good with the like minded people has been a blessing. Its the trust shown by Kunjal &amp; team that has been the torchbearer &amp; helped me to manage the faridabad centre smoothly.</p>
