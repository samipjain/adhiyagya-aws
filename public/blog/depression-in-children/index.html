<div class="content"><p>Depression is a subject that no one wants to talk about in our country probably due to the lack of knowledge on the subject. The worse form of this mental health issue is the one that goes undetected. Many eyebrows have been raised regarding this issue and YES IT DOES EXIST!</p>

<p>Now the question is - What is Depression? How do we know we are depressed and it is not just a sad phase? The easiest answer to this question is that when sadness prevails for longer than usual and it hinders with one’s day to day activity, then it can be considered as a symptom of depression. While most of the adults are capable enough to understand the symptoms of depression, it is a colossal struggle to actually detect the symptoms of depression among children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Depression is a controversial topic and is always viewed in a negative light. To admit that one is depressed as an adult is a different story, but to admit that their child is going through depression is an altogether different thing and sometimes is even more tabooed than an adult depression.</p>

<p>Some parents when bombarded with the information about their child being in depression do raise a curious question. The question mostly takes the form of, “How do you know it is depression and not just some behavioural anomaly?“ or “It can be just a sad phase or a reaction to some problem our child must be facing in the school?” Well these are some valid questions as there are chances of symptoms being false positives but in most cases if the symptoms prevail longer than usual, chances are that your child is in depression and something must be done urgently.</p>

<p>But is this a problem that the parents are willing to take seriously and do something about it? In most of the cases the problem is not taken care of because it is shrugged off as a behavioural problem or a temper tantrum. Child or even teen depression is a matter of serious concern. Rural India is the worst example of this kind of situation where a dysfunctional behaviour is mostly shrugged off because people have neither the knowledge nor the resources.</p>
<p>How do we detect the symptoms of depression? Symptoms of clinical depression in children can vary, but most common symptoms are extreme mood swings, sadness, fatigue, loss in concentration, restlessness, pessimism, hopelessness, too much crying, not willing to socialise or play with other children, overeating or appetite loss. These are some of the symptoms that should be the indication of depression if they persist for more than a usual amount of time.</p>
<p>Now the question arises that ‘why does this happen?’ There can be many reasons as to why a child or a teenager can fall into depression.</p>

<p>1. The environment at home. There can be depression problems arising as a result of fights between parents at home or fights in general. A child can easily become adapted to being sad because his/her parents fight.</p>
<p>2. Pressure created by parents and relatives to live up to certain expectations. There are two types of expectations that are most prevalent the first one is the academic expectation and the second is social expectation. Children are forced to portray their precocious talents and are expected to be at the top of their class. They are often levied with statements like “why don’t you study and get good marks?” or “Why can’t your marks be like Mr X’s kid?” This often submits a child into the arms of depression where the journey of low self-esteem and self-doubt begins.</p>
<p>3. The third could be bullying. Bullying is something almost every child faces in his/her school life. This problem is a very serious issue and is equally likely to be shrugged off as something common in school. But this has a deep set effect on a child’s brain. Getting beaten up at school or getting mentally harassed at school can have an impact that can’t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>4. Depression among teenagers can be due to peer pressure at school. A much prevalent reason for depression is the impact of social media on these children. The pressure to live a certain lifestyle and maintain an image can often lead to depression or suicidal tendencies.</p>

<p>This brings us to the most important aspect which is ‘How can depression be cured?’ Depression can be identified when people, especially parents are educated about it. Having knowledge about this subject can actually help parents to identify this problem at an early stage. This can be done via seminars arranged at schools where an in-depth idea can be given to them. Children should be made comfortable and should be encouraged to talk to someone (their teachers, parents, etc.) about what they are facing. Healthy environment should be provided to a child at home and at school. If teacher notices some odd dysfunctional behaviour then he/she should immediately talk to the parents. Treatments like psychotherapy are suggested by doctors. In this therapy session a child is encouraged to talk to a trained professional.</p>

<p>Depression in children and teenagers is a serious issue and it should be dealt with the same seriousness .It is often waived off as sadness or weakness in our society. It SHOULD NOT be considered a taboo. It is through education and knowledge and proper awareness that we can actually cure it or prevent it from happening.</p>

<p><b>“It’s okay to not to be okay!"</b> Just remember, depression in children can be treated if we don’t ignore it and fight back together by supporting our children!</p>
