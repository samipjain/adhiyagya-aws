<div class="content"><p>George Santayana, a famous principal figure in Classical American Philosophy said, <b>"A child educated only at school is an uneducated child"</b>. A properly imparted education to the children can be the answer to the many socio-economic problems prevailing in the Indian society. The process of growing up from a child to an adult requires proper nurturing and attention. The part of nurturing involves participation of parents in every sphere of life however through this article the focus will be on the participation of parents in a child's education.</p>

<p>First, let’s get enlightened by the potential reasons of parents not participating in their child's education. Here the word ‘participation’ mainly stresses on the fact that merely the attention paid by the teachers in the school is not enough. The concept of participation of parents in their child's education is a less understood concept especially in India. The neglect of parents' participation due to heavy work schedule or from a sheer assumption that school has covered every thing is a very common problem we see in our country.</p>

<p>The second reason why the parents fail to participate in their child's studies is because they assume that they must develop an in-depth knowledge of the subject before they could show some significant participation. A parent does not necessarily need to know the in-depth knowledge of subject. A normal follow up of some questions like, "What is going on in school?", "How was the test?", "What is the subject you struggle with?", could be the starting point of participation. This can gradually increase to parents regularly meeting the concerned teachers and getting the correct insight on their child's performance. This participation is important as it also serves as a bonding time between the parent and the child. As highlighted it helps in understanding about the weak points of a child. <i>"Hamara baccha mehnat nai karta to iske number nai aate" (Our kid doesn’t work hard due to which he is not able to score well)</i> or <i>"School mai dhyaan nai dete isliye hamara baccha ache number nai la paata" (The school doesn’t pay attention towards my child, maybe that is the reason my child is not able to score well)</i>. These are some of the very common notions Indian parents tend to believe. </p>

<p>There is a third side to this story where a child's weakness is not taken into consideration. It is often considered as a disinterest from the child's side or everything is burdened upon the notoriousness of the child. Parents need to embrace the importance of their participation in order to understand the third side of this story. A child's effort in scoring good marks depends a lot on the kind of support he gets once he reaches home.  There can be a reason other than the lack of interest (what most of the parents believe) as to why a child cannot get through a simple mathematics problem or a complicated physics problem.</p>

<p>This lack of concentration originated from a very basic problem. The involvement of parents in their child's studies is important because it keeps the child on toes. It leads to a better understanding on both the sides. Parents tend to complain a lot as to why their child is not able to perform well in the class or why is he/she weak in something. The involvement will clear these kinds of doubts. They tend to learn a lot as they come to know what the weak point of their child is or what has to be worked upon.</p>

<p>A child's education involves a dual participation from the school's side as well as from the parental side. There are many instances where a child performs without any participation at home but there are equal or even more cases where a child lags behind just because no one is ready to understand the real problem. These are the cases where a child is not able to understand what is going on and this can lead to low self-esteem, low self-confidence and even depression (which is another underestimated and unacknowledged problem of our society). Child depression is a very common problem that is often overlooked in our country.</p>

<p>To conclude, it is important that parents participate in their child's education no matter what. This participation has to be consistent and should always include an understanding and reassuring nature of a parent towards their child. The fact that the solution to this big problem lies in this small activity has to be acknowledged by the parents if they want an all round and healthy development of their child.</p>
